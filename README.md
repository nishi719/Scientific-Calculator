  scientific calculator in cpp using classes


 --->> INTRODUCTION 
The scientific calculator is a type of an electronic calculator in which different calculating methods are involved. The methods contain scientific, mathematical 
and some methods related to engineering.These types of calculators are used when one is going for a higher education, because higher education contains these 
types of essential elements. Other than that, the scientific calculators have more features as compared to the ordinary calculator in which many kinds of calculations
can be performed. The functions which are involved in this type of calculator are scientific notation, floating point values, logarithmic functions, exponential 
functions, complex numbers, fractions, equation solving, matrix calculations, conversion of units and physical constants. The scientific calculator is used in various fields
for example in astronomy, geology, physics, chemistry, somehow in biology as well. The calculators are mostly used by the students studying in schools, colleges, universities. 
This project is also mainly used for doing advanced mathematical functions in a single computer program. All the basic header files are used in this project, 
#include <cmath> has the major role in doing this project. The scientific calculator consistsof all four basic operators like: addition (+), subtraction (-), 
multiplication (*) and division (/). In addition to this italso includes mathematical functions like: percentage ,power ,logarithm ,exponential ,trigonometry 
,lowest common factor ,greatest common factor ,factorial ,permutation and combination ,linear equation ,quadratic equation ,unit 
conversion ,number system conversion ,matrix calculation and complex number calculations. This project uses simple functions for doing the calculations. SoI 
hope this project makes the system more feasible and flexible. It makes the calculations easier.



---->  HEADER FILES USED 
      1 - #includes<iostream.h> - It takes input and displays output from the console usingcin and cout, respectively.
      2 - #includes<cmath> - It is used to perform common mathematical operations like sqrt(), pow(), sin(), log(), tan(), cos()……..etc.
      3 - #include<process.h> -to declare exit () functions.
      4 - #includes<fstream.h> - It is an input-output file stream class. It provides support for simultaneous input and output operations that is to write, read, open the text files in the program.
      5 - #include<iomanip> -It defines the manipulator functions setw(),setbase(),setfill(),setiosflags ,etc…
